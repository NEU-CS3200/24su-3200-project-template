# get_db() returns a mysql.connector connection, creating one
# the first time it's called in a request and reusing it after.
#
# Flask's `g` object is a request-scoped store: anything placed
# in `g` lives for exactly one request and is cleaned up when
# the request ends. That cleanup is registered via init_app().

    # only when a route actually needs it. init_app's only job is to make
    # sure the cleanup always happens, even if the route raises an exception.
